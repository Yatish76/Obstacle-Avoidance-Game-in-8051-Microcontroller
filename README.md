# Obstacle-Avoidance-Game-in-8051-Microcontroller-
In this project I have designed Obstacle Avoidance game on 8051 microcontroller. I have used embedded c for implementation. I have used 16x2 LCD unit for display. In this game,
random obstacles will be generated and we have to dodge them by using controls on laptop key board. USB to UART module is used for integration of microcontroller and keyboard.
